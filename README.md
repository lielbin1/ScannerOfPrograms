# Weakness Vulnerability
### A project as part of an internship at "Rezilion", cyber-security start-up.

Vulnerability scanner for software installed on the computer in the Windows operating system.

Tools- 
The gensim library, the library contains a variety of tools such as: Topic modeling (LDA), word embedding (word2vec) and other very useful models for understanding word relationships such as LSI.

Using a search engine algorithm to find the Vulnerability for each software

A search engine consists of:
- Dictionary of all the words in the document repository (for each word in which documents it is located).
- Inverted dictionary of all documents (for each document what words it contains).
- A similarity function between the documents and a query whose function will be to rank the relevant documents returned according to the level of relevance.


The library offers easy-to-use implementation for the above components.



An example of the output of the scanner on my computer:
